# Covid-19-Statistics
Shows statistics from countries hit by the corona virus disease(Covid-19). The data includes current cases, deaths, recovered patients etc. We are fetching data using the API from [NovelCOVID](https://github.com/NovelCOVID)
Using this data, we want to be able to **predict** the total number of people that will get infected, recover or die in the next month and the impact it will have on small scale entrepreneurs. This will allow countries and businesses to plan better ahead of time, these actions can help save a lot of **people's lives** and **economies around the world**.
